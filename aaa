1 what is pico?
pico:  object detection with pixel intensity comparisons organized in decision trees[2].
2 pico framework.
vj=haar-like feature+adaboost+cascade.
 Pico is a modification of vj framework.
Pico=pixel intensity comparisons + gentle boost + chain-like cascade
3 The reason we use pico instead of pixels is that all the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among tags[1].
4 pico binary test:
binTest(I; I1,I2) equals 0 if I(I1)<I(I2), equals 1 otherwise. Here I1 and I2 are coordinates drawn from [-1,1]x[-1,1].
5 How to select binary test?
We select binary test in each internal node of our tree in a way to minimize the weighted mean squared error obtained when training data is split by the test.
6 difference with vj algorithm.
Vj uses the best haar-like feature as its weak classifier which can be viewed tree of depth 1, but pico uses tree of some depth instead.
7 Ensemble of trees
Pico uses GentleBoost and vj uses AdaBoost.( almost same)
8 Cascade:
Vj uses cascade to reject non-objects at early stages, with little processing time spent.
Pico uses chain-like cascade, which is much like vj cascade, but also uses previous stage as an additional information to improve current stage’s discriminability, thus improving convergence of each stage classifier[3].
9 The advantages of pico compared with vj.
One, does not require computation of integral images.
Two, all binary tests in internal nodes of the trees are based on the same feature, but vj used 5 different types.
Three, no need for image pre-processing( such as normalization, resizing, smoothing).
Four, can easily be modified for fast detection of in-plane rotated objects.
